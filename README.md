## COURSE GOALS

This course introduces principles of computer organization and design. It will allow understanding of performance evaluation of computers, the principles of designing the hardware/software interface, a simple implementation of MIPS ISA, and a pipelined implementation of MIPS ISA. You will also understand memory hierarchy and I/O devices and interfaces.
